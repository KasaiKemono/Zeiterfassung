# README

This script is intended to measure time. You press Enter, it starts, you press Enter again, it stops. Easy as pie. 
Basically, it's a simple Stopwatch with timestamps. 

The icon from the .exe is made by Alessandro Roncone, who is not affiliated with me in any way - I found it on google. 
You may find his works on https://github.com/alecive and http://www.iconarchive.com/artist/alecive.html.
